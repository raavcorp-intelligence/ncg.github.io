Flurry for Windows

***************************************************************************

- This is a port to Windows of Flurry, a beautiful screen saver for
  Mac OS X written by Calum Robinson (http://homepage.mac.com/calumr/).
- Calum credits the original Windows version, Seraphim, by Brian Wade
  (brianwade@va.prestige.net). I can't find any trace of this any more.

***************************************************************************
** Instructions
***************************************************************************

- Copy the Flurry screensaver file (Flurry.scr) to your Windows directory.
  Use the Screen Saver tab of the Desktop control panel to select and
  configure Flurry.
  
- You can also right click the Flurry.scr file and choose Install


Note: this is an OpenGL screensaver and some Intel driver disable hardware
acceleration for OpenGL screensavers, rendering them extremely slow.
You might try to rename the file to Flurry.sCr as a workaround.

==== Release 1.2 ====

Version 1.2.1.8 (07/02/08)
	- Use ScrnSave.Lib from VS2005 as the latest version has a dependency on the Vista
	  version of user32.dll
	- Added dialog icon
	- Corrected version & build info retrieval
	- Added theme manifest
	- New icon
	- Merged Readme & Release documents

Version 1.2.0.4 (02/13/05)
	- Fixes errors when reading from registry if the keys don't exist
	- Removed deprecated function calls
	- Added new About Box.
	- Builds 1-3: Developer builds
 
	Known bugs:
		- Hitting Test too many times triggers bad behavior on my NVidia card.
		- Double buffering and multimon interact poorly (slow flip).
		- The screen saver config applet might crash on ATI cards, though
		  the screen saver should function fine if invoked standalone (/c or /s).
		  Note that other problems reported by users with Radeon cards seem to
		  go away when using the newest Catalyst drivers.


==== Release 1.1 ====

Version 1.1.1.11 (8/19/2003)
	- Fixes crash when using the preview in the Screen Saver tab of Display Properties
	  with some ATI Radeon video cards/drivers.

Version 1.1.0.10 (8/10/2003)
	- Tries to automatically throttle the distance between frames on slower graphics cards,
	  so if the rendering isn't keeping up, it gets slower instead of darker
	- "Shrink by %" setting, editable in registry, allows you to use only part of the screen
	  for Flurry (another way to speed it up if it's too slow)
	- Other timing related fixes
	- May work better if your desktop is configured for 16 bit color depth

	- Test button in configuration mode invokes screensaver with current, unsaved settings

	- Read visuals from registry, support custom visuals (no UI yet)

Version 1.0.0.7 (5/29/2003)
	- Allow selection of visual in UI (predefined visuals only)
	- Fix multimon bug if primary monitor doesn't start at (0, 0)

Version 1.0.0.6 (5/29/2003)
	- In multimon mode, each flurry draws independently (but they're all the same visual)
	- Support visuals other than Classic (must edit registry to select)

	- Multimon support (whole desktop, primary monitor, each monitor but all the same)
