# Natural Conversation Generation
(NCG) or Natural Conversation Generation is a tool used for AI or other programs to create a user interaction that is most similar to a real face to face interaction

`NCG` is still being developed, if you would like to contribute please contact Ryan Vogel "info@raavcorp.com"

Our goal is to create a text gererator that is based on text messages and DM's between people so that our nerual network can train off of the text messages to create a semi-reallife experiance.

Here is an example of the data being inputed:
```
# The Diffrent people would be staggered on every other line
"Hey how are you"
"im, good thanks for asking"
# If the text was passed with multiple lines like:
# Hey how are you
# What are you doing today?
# It would be conjoined together
```
